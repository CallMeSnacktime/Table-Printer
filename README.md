# Table-Printer
Practice example taken from "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" Chapter 6

The goal of this program was to take in a nested list called tableData and write a function that displays organized columns that are right-justified.

  apples Alice dogs<br>
  oranges Bob cats<br>
  cherries Carol moose<br>
  banana David goose<br>
  
  I used nested for loops to solve this problem
